# WhatsApp

WhatsApp is the most popular mobile communication tool in the world, offering free messaging to individuals and groups and operating on all phone types. Until November 2014, using WhatsApp was considered highly insecure and was not recommend for anyone who required any level of security in their communications. It now offers strong end-to-end encryption.

Since November 2014, WhatsApp has been partnering with and integrating the secure code of a well-respected privacy and technology company (Open Whisper Systems) into its product. This means that its messages now have a very strong level of  security, and WhatsApp can no longer easily view or be forced to handover messages to authorities.

However it is very important to note:

*   Does not encrypt any pictures sent once they arrive on the phone
*   While WhatsApp or others cannot view the content of your messages, they can still know that you are communication with someone (e.g metadata). In some cases, this may still have negative security consequences.
* 	It is possible for someone to try to intercept your communications by changing a contact's security code. To ensure you are warned about someone trying to do this, go to Settings -> Account -> Security -> Turn on "Show security notifications" 

For these reasons we still recommend that you use Signal - available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669) for secure messaging and calls.
